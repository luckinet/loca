# Module 1 - Setup framework and prepare data

This module has the purpose of preparing all data that are required for a specific model run. This includes

1)  setting up a model profile, where all the important model parameters are recorded,
2)  building tiles for the spatial subset defined in the model profile and subsetting all input data for the current model run,
3)  pre-processing several gridded layers, such as the landcover basis, pixel areas or pixelated layers of administrative,
4)  defining the interaction between landcover, land use and the target agricultural and forestry commodities.

## Model profile

At the start of any LUCA model-run, a model profile needs to be specified. The profile contains information about temporal, spatial and thematic extent of the model. The information recorded here are of such a nature that they are valid and available for all following modules.

## Spatial subset

## Interaction between concepts

## Pre-processing gridded layers
