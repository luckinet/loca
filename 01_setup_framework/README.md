# Module 1: Setup framework and prepare data

This module has the purpose of preparing all data that are required for a specific model run. This includes

1)  setting up a model profile, where all the important meta-data are recorded,
2)  specifying a spatial subset,
3)  pre-processing several gridded layers, such as the landcover basis, pixel areas or pixelated layers of administrative areas,
4)  preparing all the areal and point data for the spatial subset and finally
5)  preparing the ontological basis

## Model profile

The LUCKINet modular pipeline starts with a model profile. The profile contains information about temporal, spatial and thematic extent of the model. The information recorded here are of such a nature that they are valid and available for all following modules.

## Spatial subset

## Landcover and its' restrictions

## Pixel areas

## Areal and point data
