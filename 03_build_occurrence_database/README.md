# Module 3.2 - Occurrence database

The database of the occurrence records contains in-situ landcover, land use or agricultural commodities occurrences from already elsewhere collated (but incomplete) databases and the (grey) literature.

## Tools

The occurrence database is built with [functions included in this repository](https://github.com/luckinet/luca/blob/main/02_boot_functions.R) for organizing the database and `ontologics` to harmonize concepts.

Each script follows a clearly defined template, where

1)  the meta-data are recorded,
2)  concepts are entered into the LUCKINet land use ontology,
3)  the data are processed to end up in a standardized format.

## Database structure

Each script produces an `*.rds`-file that contains a data-frame of the harmonized data of that data-set and, in case the data-set is an areal data-set, a geopackage (gpkg) file that contains the polygons. Each harmonized table then contains the following columns:

| name          | type      | description                                                                                                                          |

| presence      | logical   | whether the data-point indicates presence of 'externalValue' (TRUE), or whether it indicates its absence (FALSE)                     |

| LC1/2/3_orig  | class     | in case the data-set contains additionally information on landcover (not land use), the explicit value is recorded here              |
| sample_type   | class     | the type of sampling, either "field (sampling)", "visual interpretation", "area knowledge", "meta study" or "modeled (data-product)" |
| collector     | class     | what group of people has collected the data, either "expert", "citizen scientist" or "student"                                       |

## Post-processing

After collecting all information in a harmonized database some further steps are required. The final script `99_make_database.R` carries these out:

-   re-project all coordinates to epsg:4326 (WGS84), in case they are not yet in this coordinate reference system.
-   calculate precision of the coordinates (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees>).
-   derive the spatial unit size.
-   carry out checks via `coordinateCleaner` R package.
-   determine quality flags for provenance documentation.
