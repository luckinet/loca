description <- "The data were collected in the humid tropical climate on Sumatra (Indonesia) in rain forests, in jungle rubber (rubber planted into forests), in rubber, and oil palm plantations. A total of 44 plots were sampled. The data set consists of two tables. The table Environmental_data contains plot information, geographic coordinates of the plots, and data on soil properties (pH, nitrogen, carbon, C/N, potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, iron, phosporous, soil resource index, soil PC1, soil PC2) and on root traits (biomass, nitrogen, carbon, C/N, potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, iron, phosporous, root resource index, root PC1, soil PC, root vitality). Table 2 contain abundance data (OTU counts) for fungi associated with roots or with soil and their phylogenetic and functional assignments."
